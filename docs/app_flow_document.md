# TON Game App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user launches the TON game from within Telegram, the first screen they encounter is an authentication prompt that leverages Telegram OAuth. The app is accessed directly as a Telegram Mini App, so users are already within the messaging environment and benefit from a mobile-first design. Users are guided to log in using their Telegram credentials, which are authenticated through integrated Supabase Auth and JWT. For sign-up, the process is seamless since Telegram credentials are used, and any additional required details are captured in a simple form. If users need to recover lost passwords or encounter any issues with authentication, a secured recovery process is available which might include email verification through Supabase, ensuring they can regain access without hassle. Signing out is simple and immediately returns the user to the authentication screen to protect user data.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successful login, users are welcomed by the main dashboard which is designed for a mobile environment. The dashboard features a navigation menu clearly laid out from left to right with items including Home, Ranking, Play, Store, and Settings. The Home section immediately presents a dynamic list of quests along with a daily login bonus feature. Users see clear indicators for available quests that include tasks like joining Telegram groups, connecting a digital wallet, or interacting on social media. Visual cues such as the Good Times font, vibrant deep violet tones, and a contrasting black purple background ensure that the interface is both attractive and readable. The design of the dashboard allows users to move effortlessly from one section to another, ensuring that exploration of quests, rankings, game play options, and store items is intuitive and fluid.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once on the Home screen, users are invited to engage with the quest list. Every quest on the list provides detailed instructions such as joining a Telegram group, linking a digital wallet, or performing social media actions, making the process straightforward. Daily login rewards are automatically granted, and users see a running tally of bonus points that are added with each consecutive login. If a user wishes to see how they stack up against others, the Ranking section is accessible from the navigation menu and displays leaderboard information based on points earned from quest completions.

When a user wants to play the game, they navigate to the Play section where a centrally located play button, reminiscent of popular video play interfaces, awaits. Once clicked, the screen transitions to a music selection area where users can choose from a variety of soundtracks. After selecting a track, the embedded Unity WebGL game launches in the same interface. Throughout the game experience, user sessions are managed securely, ensuring that game progress, scores, and relevant data are transmitted back to the backend via secure API endpoints. Real-time feedback allows users to monitor their game performance and see immediate updates in the ranking module. In the Store section, users can use the points earned from quests and gameplay to purchase items such as point multipliers and game score enhancers. This transaction process uses the usersâ€™ in-app wallet and is designed to update their point balance immediately upon purchase, creating a seamless shopping experience.

The app also includes an advanced administrator interface available via the /admin path. Here, administrators and developers manage the entire game experience. They can create, edit, or delete quests, set conditions and rewards, manage store items, and monitor user progress. The admin dashboard offers rich analytical dashboards with detailed views of user activity including total and active user counts, daily login statistics, quest completions, and in-app purchase histories. In addition, the admin tool features a moderation workflow where newly created quests and store items enter a Pending Review status until they are validated by an administrator, ensuring that all content published on the user side meets quality and compliance standards.

## Settings and Account Management

Users have a dedicated Settings area where they can manage their in-app profile and additional preferences. The Settings page allows users to update personal information, review account details, and manage their linked wallets. They can modify game-related preferences such as audio levels and notification settings, which also include dynamic Telegram bot messages for real-time updates. Furthermore, users can access their transaction history and monitor their current points balance. Once changes have been made, a clear option allows them to return to the main dashboard without interrupting the flow of their experience. This consistency helps maintain the familiarity of the mobile interface while giving users complete control over their personal data and gameplay experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If users enter invalid information during login or while updating their account details, the system immediately presents clear, easy-to-understand error messages. For example, if the Telegram OAuth fails due to connectivity issues or if a Supabase session expires, the app displays a friendly error with instructions on how to proceed. This may include re-authentication, refreshing the page, or even guiding the user to a recovery process. In cases where users try to access restricted content or pages without proper permissions, they are redirected to a fallback page that provides additional guidance on how to gain access, such as contacting support. Similarly, if an attempt to purchase an item in the Store fails due to insufficient points or a server error, the interface provides a clear explanation and offers options to retry or contact support. These error states are handled in a way that users always have a clear path to recover and continue their experience without feeling lost.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The TON Game app offers a seamless and engaging experience from the very first step a user takes when launching the app within Telegram. Beginning with a secure, streamlined sign-up process through Telegram OAuth, the app then guides users through a beautifully designed mobile-first dashboard that highlights quests, rankings, gameplay, and storefront interactions. Users engage with daily rewards and interactive quests which naturally lead to competitive gameplay via an embedded Unity WebGL experience. They can further enhance their journey by shopping in the Store with points earned, while the Settings area provides comprehensive account and preference management. On the administrative side, robust management and analytical tools ensure quality and smooth operational control. Whether users are in the midst of a challenging gameplay session or reviewing their progress, every page and interaction is designed to function as part of a fully connected experience that is both secure and adaptable. In the end, the journey from onboarding to everyday interactions is clear, consistent, and purposefully crafted to keep users engaged and informed at every stage.
